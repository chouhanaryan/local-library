# **local-library**

Website for a local library built in Django based upon the tutorial by MDN.

The tutorial can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website.

I have built upon the original project by adding several features and quality of life adjustments.
