# local-library
Website for a local library built in Django based upon the tutorial by MDN.

The tutorial can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website.

I have built upon the original project by adding several feature and quality of life adjustments.

To make sure I learn as much as possible, i included the following -

1. Image uploading & templating

2. Basic form systems (# plan to implement django-widget-tweaks in future #)

3. Created as many links and make the models as interconnected as possible

4. Used basic Bootstrap and CSS (# figured out how to use CSS for other .html files while working on the next project so could not 
implement it here #)

5. Extended use of paginators

6. Made the Admin panels as clean as possible

7. Implemented use of Users and Authentication to display different fields based upon user

8. Added 'My Account' functionality to display Borrowed/Reserved books
